\title{Get H3 cell index within a polygon}
\usage{
polyfill(geometry = NULL, res = NULL, simple = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{geometry}{`sf` object of type 'POLYGON' or 'MULTIPOLYGON'.}

\item{res}{Integer; Desired H3 resolution. See
\url{https://h3geo.org/docs/core-library/restable/} for allowable values and related dimensions.}

\item{simple}{Logical; whether to return a vector of outputs or an sf object
containing both inputs and outputs.}
}
\value{
By default, a list of length(h3_address). Each list element contains
  a character vector of H3 cell indices belonging to that geometry. A result of
  NA indicates that no H3 cell indices of the chosen resolution are centered
  over the geometry.
}
\description{
This function returns all the H3 cell index within the supplied polygon
geometry.
}
\note{
This function will be slow with a large number of polygons, and/or
  polygons that are large relative to the hexagon area at the chosen
  resolution. A message is printed to console where the total input area is
  (roughly) > 100000x the area of the chosen H3 resolution.
}
\examples{
# Which level 5 H3 cell indices have centers inside County Ashe, NC?
nc <- sf::st_read(system.file("shape/nc.shp", package="sf"), quiet = TRUE)
nc1 <- nc[1, ]
fillers <- polyfill(geometry = nc1, res = 5)
