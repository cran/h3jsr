\name{h3_to_polygon}
\alias{h3_to_polygon}
\title{Get the boundary of an H3 cell index}
\usage{
h3_to_polygon(input = NULL, simple = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{Character; 15-character index generated by H3, or a
vector or list of same, or a data frame where the first column contains H3
addresses.}

\item{simple}{Logical; whether to return an `sfc_POLYGON` object or an `sf`
data frame containing both inputs and outputs.}
}
\value{
By default, an `sfc_POLYGON` object of `length(input)`. If an
  appropriately formatted data frame is supplied, an `sf` data frame
  containing input attributes and geometry.
}
\description{
This function takes an H3 cell index and returns its bounding shape (usually a
hexagon) in WGS84.
}
\examples{
# What is the hexagon over the Brisbane Town Hall at resolution 10?
brisbane_hex_10 <- h3_to_polygon(input = '8abe8d12acaffff')

# Give me some of the cells over Brisbane Town Hall as an sf object
bth <- sf::st_sfc(sf::st_point(c(153.023503, -27.468920)), crs = 4326)
bth_addys <- unlist(point_to_h3(bth, res = seq(10, 15)), use.names = FALSE)
bth_hexes <- h3_to_polygon(input = bth_addys)
plot(bth_hexes, axes = TRUE)
