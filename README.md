# h3jsr

h3jsr provides access to [Uber’s H3 library](https://github.com/uber/h3)
via its [javascript transpile](https://github.com/uber/h3-js), using the
magical power of [`V8`](https://github.com/jeroen/v8).

H3 is a hexagonal hierarchical geospatial indexing system. Details about
its structure and use cases [can be found
here](https://h3geo.org/docs/).

## Installation

Install from github with

``` r
remotes::install_github("obrl-soil/h3jsr")
```

## Example

``` r
library(h3jsr)
library(sf)
#> Linking to GEOS 3.9.0, GDAL 3.2.1, PROJ 7.2.1

# where is the Brisbane Town Hall at resolution 15?
bth <- st_sfc(st_point(c(153.023503, -27.468920)), crs = 4326)
point_to_h3(bth, res = 15)
#> [1] "8fbe8d12acad2f3"

# where is it at several resolutions?
point_to_h3(bth, res = seq(10, 15), simple = FALSE)
#>   h3_resolution_10 h3_resolution_11 h3_resolution_12 h3_resolution_13
#> 1  8abe8d12acaffff  8bbe8d12acadfff  8cbe8d12acad3ff  8dbe8d12acad2ff
#>   h3_resolution_14 h3_resolution_15
#> 1  8ebe8d12acad2f7  8fbe8d12acad2f3

# Where is the center of the hexagon over the Brisbane Town 
# Hall at resolution 10?

#> [1] FALSE

# What is Brisbane Town Hall's base cell number?

# What is the hexagon over the Brisbane Town Hall at resolution 10?

# if you're feeling fancy,
# point_to_h3(bth, res = seq(10,15)) %>%
#   unlist() %>%
#   h3_to_polygon(., simple = FALSE) %>%
#   mapview::mapview()
  
```

Props to Joel Gombin, who’s package
[`concaveman`](https://github.com/joelgombin/concaveman) provided me
with the implementation inspo.
