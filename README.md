# h3jsr

h3jsr provides access to [Uber’s H3 library](https://github.com/uber/h3)
via its [javascript transpile](https://github.com/uber/h3-js), using the
magical power of [`V8`](https://github.com/jeroen/v8).

H3 is a hexagonal hierarchical geospatial indexing system. Details about
its structure and use cases [can be found
here](https://h3geo.org/docs/).

## Installation

Install from CRAN with

``` r
install.packages('h3jsr')
```

Install the development version from GitHub with

``` r
remotes::install_github("obrl-soil/h3jsr")
```

> :bulb: The latest version (v1.3.0) contains an API revision, so some
> functions have new names. See the NEWS.

## Example

``` r
library(h3jsr)
library(sf)
#> Linking to GEOS 3.9.1, GDAL 3.4.3, PROJ 7.2.1; sf_use_s2() is TRUE

# where is the Brisbane Town Hall at resolution 15?
bth <- st_sfc(st_point(c(153.023503, -27.468920)), crs = 4326)
point_to_cell(bth, res = 15)
#> [1] "8fbe8d12acad2f3"

# where is it at several resolutions?
point_to_cell(bth, res = seq(10, 15), simple = FALSE)
#>   h3_resolution_10 h3_resolution_11 h3_resolution_12 h3_resolution_13
#> 1  8abe8d12acaffff  8bbe8d12acadfff  8cbe8d12acad3ff  8dbe8d12acad2ff
#>   h3_resolution_14 h3_resolution_15
#> 1  8ebe8d12acad2f7  8fbe8d12acad2f3

# Where is the center of the hexagon over the Brisbane Town 
# Hall at resolution 10?
brisbane_10 <- cell_to_point(h3_address = '8abe8d12acaffff')
brisbane_10
#> Geometry set for 1 feature 
#> Geometry type: POINT
#> Dimension:     XY
#> Bounding box:  xmin: 153.0239 ymin: -27.46853 xmax: 153.0239 ymax: -27.46853
#> Geodetic CRS:  WGS 84
#> POINT (153.0239 -27.46853)

# Is that a valid H3 address?
is_valid(h3_address = '8abe8d12acaffff')
#> [1] TRUE

# is it a pentagon?
is_pentagon(h3_address = '8abe8d12acaffff')
#> [1] FALSE

# is it Class III?
is_rc3(h3_address = '8abe8d12acaffff')
#> [1] FALSE

# What is Brisbane Town Hall's base cell number?
get_base_cell(h3_address = '8abe8d12acaffff')
#> [1] 95

# What is the hexagon over the Brisbane Town Hall at resolution 10?
brisbane_hex_10 <- cell_to_polygon(input = '8abe8d12acaffff', simple = FALSE)

# if you're feeling fancy,
# point_to_cell(bth, res = seq(10,15)) %>%
#   unlist() %>%
#   h3_to_polygon(., simple = FALSE) %>%
#   mapview::mapview()

Props to Joel Gombin, who’s package
[`concaveman`](https://github.com/joelgombin/concaveman) provided me
with the implementation inspo.
